summary:     "极简主义企业家创建的企业必须要盈利，不惜一切代价。许多企业从一开始就没有打算存活很久，他们的计划是在盈利变得必要之前将企业卖掉，并在此过程中从投资者那里筹集资金。而极简主义企业家的目标是从一开始或尽快实现盈利，因为盈利对于企业来说就像氧气一样重要。他们通过向客户销售产品来实现盈利，而不是通过向广告商销售用户。"

| Atlanta-based web developer Peter Askew loves to get things off the top shelf at the supermarket for people who can’t reach the same heights he can. A six-foot-eight former high school basketball star, Askew sees being helpful as the pillar of his business strategy, but it wasn’t always that way. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001 and he was laid off from eTour, a websurfing guide he helped build and grow, he had to ask himself, “Is this how I want to live? Is this how I can be of service to the world?” He knew he could get another job thanks to his background in marketing analytics, but he was also disillusioned. Money and prestige were not nearly as important to him as independence and freedom. Eventually he wound up with another role in advertising where he was exposed to a wide range of business models as thousands of new web businesses came online, but in the evening and on weekends, he threw himself into his side projects, learning about web development, domain names, and how to monetize web traffic. | 归属于亚特兰大的网络开发者彼得·阿斯克夫（Peter Askew）非常喜欢为那些够不着高处物品的人从超市的顶层货架上拿东西。他高六英尺八英寸，曾是高中篮球明星，阿斯克夫把乐于助人视为他的商业策略的支柱，但过去并非总是如此。2001年互联网泡沫破灭时，他在帮助创建和发展的网上冲浪指南网站eTour被解雇，这时他开始问自己：“这样的生活是我想要的吗？我怎样才能对世界有所贡献呢？” 他知道凭借自己在市场分析方面的背景可以找到另一份工作，但他也感到幻灭。对他来说，金钱和声望远不及独立和自由重要。最终，他在广告领域找到了另一份工作，接触到各种各样的商业模式，因为成千上万的新网络企业开始涌现。然而，在晚上和周末，他投入到自己的副业中，学习网络开发、域名知识以及如何利用网络流量实现盈利。 |
| That’s how he stumbled on an idea that would change his life. What if instead of buying new domain names, which often took months to rank highly in search engine results, he bought expired domain names, which already had some degree of visibility? Other people were parking ads on expired domains or flipping them, but Askew had something else in mind, the seed of an idea that was driven by the questions he had started to ask himself about his work. Rather than trying to make a quick buck, he would build real businesses around domain names, asking himself with each one, “Do I feel inspired? Is there a real business here?,” and, most of all, “Can I be helpful?” | 就是这样，他偶然间发现了一个会改变他生活的点子。如果不是去购买那些通常需要数月才能在搜索引擎结果中排名靠前的全新域名，而是去买那些已经有一定曝光度的过期域名，会怎样呢？其他人可能会在这些过期域名上放广告或者转卖它们，但阿斯克夫心里有了另一个想法，这个想法是由他对自己工作开始思考的问题所驱动的。他决定不急于赚快钱，而是要在这些域名的基础上建立真正的业务。他对每一个域名都会问自己：“我是否感到激发了？这里是否真的有一个实实在在的生意？”，最重要的是，“我是否能够有所帮助？” |
| He experimented with randomly created names and ventures that didn’t quite work before he realized that “the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second.” In 2009, that domain name was [duderanch.com](http://duderanch.com/). Askew bought it and launched a directory, traveling to more than fifty dude ranches to meet the owners of the destinations he featured on his site. Eventually he partnered with the owner of [guestranches.com](http://guestranches.com/), and the two built a curated list of destination ranches around the country. The success of that venture, which he worked on for ten years and sold in 2019, gave him the time and financial freedom to buy more domain names and develop other niche businesses. Some succeeded, others didn’t. | 他在不断尝试使用随机创建的名字和尝试不同的创业项目，但并没有取得太大的成功。直到有一天，他领悟到了“先有域名，再有业务想法”的重要性。到了2009年，[他购买了一个域名叫做duderanch.com](http://xn--duderanch-u75noo60awi03bo8mmrqrqa936cy32v.com/)。随后，他创建了一个目录网站，并亲自前往超过五十个度假牧场，与这些度假胜地的主人见面，然后将它们收录在自己的网站上。最终，他与guestranches.com的主人合作，共同建立了一个全国各地的目的地牧场精选列表。这个创业项目他投入了整整十年的心血，并在2019年将其出售。这次成功的创业使他获得了时间和财务上的自由，能够购买更多的域名并开发其他细分市场的业务。虽然其中一些项目取得了成功，但也有一些并未如愿。 |
| In 2014, Askew saw that [VidaliaOnions.com](http://vidaliaonions.com/) was up for auction. Until then, he had focused on information-based businesses, but something about the domain name appealed to him. So did the onions, frankly. As a Georgia native, he knew of Vidalias—a sweet, mild variety that some fans eat raw like an apple. The only trouble was that he didn’t know anything about the onion business. Or farming in general, for that matter. Regardless, he put down a $2,200 bid, confident that someone in the business would come in higher. (If bidding on interesting domain names like this sounds like a neat hobby, you may be a minimalist entrepreneur.) When he won the auction five minutes later, he was pleasantly surprised, but he filed it away for later and went back to work on other projects. As the days went by, though, he couldn’t stop thinking about Vidalias. “[The domain] kept nudging me,” he writes in his essay “I Sell Onions on the Internet,” and “after a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry & David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door Vidalia onions.” He saw a way he could be helpful to others, and a new minimalist business was born. Askew didn’t eat Vidalias himself, but he knew that many people did, both from his own experience and from strong search volume for the phrase on Google Trends. But he still had his doubts. “I’m not a farmer,” he worried. “I have no logistics or distribution system setup.” He got started anyway. His first step was to reach out to a trade group that put him in touch with Aries Haygood, the owner of an award-winning Vidalia farm in operation for over two decades that had, crucially, a packing shed. He used his own money to put up a new site on [VidaliaOnions.com](http://vidaliaonions.com/), and then, “[while] the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, & logistics,” he recalled. “I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.” | 在2014年，阿斯克夫发现VidaliaOnions.com域名正在拍卖中。此前，他一直专注于信息类的企业，但这个域名以及洋葱本身引起了他的兴趣。作为乔治亚州的本地人，他熟知维迪利亚洋葱——一种甜味温和的品种，有些人甚至像吃苹果一样生吃它们。唯一的问题是，他对洋葱业务一无所知。实际上，他对农业也一窍不通。 尽管如此，他还是出价2200美元，相信肯定会有人出更高的价。如果像这样竞拍有趣的域名听起来像一个有趣的爱好，你可能就是一个极简主义的企业家。当他五分钟后赢得拍卖时，他感到惊喜，但他将这件事放在心里，然后继续着手处理其他项目。 然而，随着日子的流逝，他无法停止对维迪利亚洋葱的思考。他在自己的文章《我在互联网上卖洋葱》中写道：“[这个域名]一直在向我暗示”，“一个月后，我开始理解它传达的意思。那就是，我每年都会从Harry & David购买梨子，而我应该为维迪利亚洋葱提供相同的服务。就像是从农场送货到门口的梨子，我可以提供从农场送货到门口的维迪利亚洋葱。”他看到了自己可以帮助他人的方式，一个新的极简主义企业就此诞生。 阿斯克夫自己并不吃维迪利亚洋葱，但他知道很多人吃，这一点既是他自己的经验，也是通过Google趋势上强大的搜索量得知的。但他仍然有些犹豫。“我不是农民，”他担心道，“我没有设置物流或分销系统。” 尽管如此，他还是开始了。首先，他与一个贸易团体取得联系，后来他认识了Aries Haygood，一个经营了二十多年的屡获殊荣的维迪利亚洋葱农场的主人，而且还有一个关键的打包棚。他用自己的钱在VidaliaOnions.com上建了一个新的网站，然后回忆说：“在农场专注于洋葱的种植过程中，我则专注于客户服务、市场营销、品牌塑造、网站开发和物流。”“我没有其他项目像这样直接面向客户。我发现我非常喜欢这个。” |
| Askew and Haygood estimated fifty orders for their first season. They received more than six hundred. It would be at this point in the life cycle of a VC-funded business that the investors would start getting frisky. “Six hundred orders when we expected fifty?” they’d exclaim. “Time to quintuple your hiring. Come to think of it, what does the international market for Vidalia onions look like? A few million in ad spending, a viral video, and we’ll have Vidalias trending worldwide. We’ll probably need people on the ground in London, Tokyo, and Sydney. Time to raise another round.” And on it goes. Picture a little kid blowing a balloon up for the first time, until . . . Askew himself couldn’t help but consider trying to accelerate the company’s growth, but he stuck to what he had learned over the years and focused instead on profitability. He knew that the previous owners of [VidaliaOnions.com](http://vidaliaonions.com/) had gone belly up trying to sell salad dressings and relishes in addition to the onions themselves. So instead, he slowly built the business in front of him, figuring out how to sell Vidalia onions to the market of potential customers within the range of timely and affordable shipping from that one packing shed. He made mistakes, of course. At one point, he lost thousands of dollars on faulty shipping boxes, an error that nearly shuttered the operation. But he also made small process improvements year by year, like implementing an automated shipping system rather than manually entering customer orders and printing UPS labels. A few years in, the business was profitable, growing organically at its own pace, and he was having fun. Six years in, Askew’s pet project has become a full-fledged business, which makes his many customers happy and has a positive impact in the local community. He no longer sees it as just another experiment along with all of his other cast-off domain names. [VidaliaOnions.com](http://vidaliaonions.com/) is becoming his mission: Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: “THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!” At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact. . . . It’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry. Maybe it’s the onions, but Askew’s story brings a tear to my eye. There is something profoundly beautiful in a value-oriented mission and a genuine purpose driven by your own lived experience. This is what being a minimalist entrepreneur is all about: making a difference while making a living. | 阿斯克夫和海古德估计第一个季度会有五十份订单。但他们实际收到了六百多份订单。 在创业公司的生命周期中，如果这是一个获得风险投资支持的企业，投资者们可能会变得非常热情。他们会惊叹道：“我们预期五十份订单，却得到了六百份？”“是时候要加倍增加员工了。说起来，维迪利亚洋葱在国际市场上的前景如何？几百万美元的广告投放，一段病毒式视频，维迪利亚洋葱将在全球热销。我们可能需要派驻员工在伦敦、东京和悉尼。是时候再融资了。”这样的建议络绎不绝。想象一个小孩第一次吹气球的画面，气球越来越大，直到...... 阿斯克夫自己也忍不住考虑加快公司的发展，但他坚持了多年的经验，专注于盈利能力。他知道之前VidaliaOnions.com的所有者尝试在洋葱本身之外销售沙拉酱和调味品时失败了。所以，他决定慢慢发展自己的企业，找出如何将维迪利亚洋葱卖给潜在客户，同时保持及时和经济的运输。 当然，他也犯过错误。有一次，他因为使用有问题的运输箱损失了数千美元，几乎让公司关门大吉。但他也一年一年地做了一些小的改进，比如推行自动化的运输系统，而不是手动输入客户订单和打印UPS标签。几年过去了，企业实现了盈利，以自己的步调有机地增长，而他也很开心。 六年过去了，阿斯克夫的小项目已经成为一个成熟的企业，让很多客户感到满意，并在当地社区产生了积极影响。他不再把它视为与其他弃用的域名一样的实验。VidaliaOnions.com正在变成他的使命： 老实说，如果我们消失了，我的客户会非常沮丧。上个季度，当我给一个先生回电话处理一个电话订单时，他的妻子接听了电话。当我介绍自己时，她中途打断了我，兴奋地对她的丈夫大喊：“维迪利亚的洋葱先生！维迪利亚的洋葱先生！快接电话！” 那一刻，我意识到我们做对了。我们在做一些正确的事情。一些有帮助的事情。一些对社区有积极影响的事情……这是非常令人满足的。我感到非常幸运能与这个行业有关联。 也许是洋葱的原因，但阿斯克夫的故事让我感动。在一个价值导向的使命和真正的目标驱动下，凭借自己的亲身经历去做出影响，这才是极简主义企业家所追求的：在谋生的同时，让世界有所改变。 |
| **The Minimalist Entrepreneur** Before I started to write this book, I wouldn’t have described myself as a minimalist entrepreneur. I would have said I was a founder committed to a new kind of startup, one that prioritized profitability over growth and positive impact over moving fast and breaking things. Instead of capturing as much value as possible, I was determined to create as much value as possible for our customers and our community. I’m not the only one. In this book, you’ll meet dozens of entrepreneurs like Peter Askew and others who are taking the same approach to building their companies. In the past years, I’ve exchanged ideas on Twitter or at conferences with all of them, and the more people I talked to, the more I felt we should label this new pathway that uses the advent of software to democratize and normalize business creation for everyone. Minimalist entrepreneurs are all unique, as is every path to success, but I’ve tried my best to coalesce my learnings into a single, repeatable playbook. | 极简主义企业家 在我开始写这本书之前，我并不认为自己是一个极简主义企业家。我会说我是一个致力于一种全新创业方式的创始人，这种方式将盈利能力置于增长之上，将积极影响放在快速发展和破坏中。我不追求尽可能多地获得价值，而是决心为我们的客户和社区创造尽可能多的价值。 而我并非独一无二。在这本书中，你将会遇到许多像彼得·阿斯克夫等人一样采用相同方式来建立公司的企业家。在过去的几年里，我通过Twitter或会议与他们进行了思想交流，而且我与越来越多的人交谈，我越觉得我们应该将这种利用软件的出现为每个人的企业创造民主化和正常化的新路径称之为“极简主义企业家”。 极简主义企业家都是独一无二的，成功的路径也各有不同，但我尽力将自己的经验总结成一个单一、可复制的行动指南。 |
| The steps to becoming a minimalist entrepreneur map to a function of the minimalist business—and, not coincidentally, to the chapters in this book. Each chapter builds on the previous one—just as addition leads to multiplication leads to algebra leads to calculus—until finally, at the end of the book, you’ll be fully equipped to become a minimalist entrepreneur yourself. You can read it all the way through, but you should also feel free to hop around; everyone is at a different stage in their business-building journey. | 成为一名极简主义企业家的步骤与构建极简主义企业的过程相互关联，而且并非巧合，也对应着本书中的章节内容。每一章都建立在前一章的基础上，就像加法导致乘法，乘法导致代数，代数导致微积分一样。最终，在本书的最后，你将完全具备成为一名极简主义企业家的能力。你可以从头到尾地阅读它，但你也可以随意跳跃阅读；每个人在创业之旅中都处于不同的阶段。 我们要通过这些章节逐步了解极简主义企业的构建过程，就像在学习数学中，我们从加法逐渐深入到乘法，再到代数，最终掌握了微积分一样。这本书会为你提供全面的知识和工具，让你在自己的创业之路上做好充分准备。你可以按顺序阅读，也可以根据自己的情况随意选择章节。每个人在创业过程中都有不同的起点和进程。 |
| PROFITABILITY FIRST Minimalist entrepreneurs create businesses that are profitable at all costs. Many businesses never intend to stick around long enough to be profitable. Instead, the plan is to sell the business before profits become necessary, raising money from investors along the way. Minimalist entrepreneurs aim to be profitable from day one or soon after, because profit is oxygen for businesses. And they do that by selling a product to customers, not by selling their users to advertisers. οSTART WITH COMMUNITY Minimalist entrepreneurs build on a foundation of community. They don’t ask “How can I help?” but are instead observant and cultivate authentic relationships. They spend time and effort to learn and to build trust, focusing on the market part of “product-market fit” (a term coined by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen for being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market) before they build anything at all. οBUILD AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE When they do build, minimalist entrepreneurs build only what they need to, automating or outsourcing the rest. Similarly, minimalist businesses do one thing and do it well. They work side by side with their customers to iterate toward a solution, and make sure it’s worth paying for, before they take it to customers outside of their communities. οSELL TO YOUR FIRST HUNDRED CUSTOMERS Minimalist entrepreneurs don’t spend time convincing people—they spend time educating people. Selling is a discovery process, and minimalist entrepreneurs use sales as an opportunity to talk to potential customers one by one about their products while simultaneously educating themselves about the problem they are trying to solve for them. Selling this way is a long game built on relationships and vulnerability, not a one-day grand opening extravaganza followed by selling to strangers. οMARKET BY BEING YOU Speaking of vulnerability, minimalist entrepreneurs share their stories, from struggle to success. The best marketing shows the world who you—and your product— really are. Minimalist entrepreneurs understand that people care about other people, and educate, inspire, and entertain whenever and wherever they can. Instead of making headlines, they make fans—who turn themselves into customers over time. οGROW YOURSELF AND YOUR BUSINESS MINDFULLY Minimalist entrepreneurs own their businesses, they don’t let their businesses own them. They don’t spend money they don’t have, and they don’t sacrifice profitability for scale. At this point, it becomes a game to lose . . . and minimalist entrepreneurs don’t lose. οBUILD THE HOUSE YOU WANT TO LIVE IN Minimalist entrepreneurs hire other minimalist entrepreneurs. Instead of following the status quo, they build their companies from first principles, alienating almost everyone. The way you do things won’t be for everyone, but it will be really great for a few people, and if you define your values early and often and tell the world who you are, they will find you. Conventional wisdom about how we work, when we work, and where we work is changing fast. Minimalist entrepreneurs understand there are few rules | 1. 优先盈利 极简主义企业家创建的企业必须要盈利，不惜一切代价。许多企业从一开始就没有打算存活很久，他们的计划是在盈利变得必要之前将企业卖掉，并在此过程中从投资者那里筹集资金。而极简主义企业家的目标是从一开始或尽快实现盈利，因为盈利对于企业来说就像氧气一样重要。他们通过向客户销售产品来实现盈利，而不是通过向广告商销售用户。 2. 从社群开始 极简主义企业家是在社群基础上构建企业的。他们不问“我怎样能帮助你？”而是观察周围，并培养真诚的关系。他们花时间和精力去学习和建立信任，在构建任何产品之前，着重关注“产品适市场”（风险投资家马克·安德森为“处于一个良好市场，且产品能满足该市场需求”的术语）。 3. 尽可能构建最少的东西 当他们开始构建时，极简主义企业家只构建他们需要的部分，其余的部分则会自动化或外包。 同样地，极简主义企业专注于做一件事，并做到最好。他们与客户并肩合作，不断迭代，确保在向社群之外的潜在客户推广之前，产品值得付费。 向你的前一百位客户销售 极简主义企业家不会花时间去说服别人，他们花时间去教育别人。销售是一个探索过程，极简主义企业家利用销售机会与潜在客户一对一地交谈，同时了解他们试图解决的问题。这样的销售是建立在关系和脆弱性上的长期过程，而不是一天的盛大开幕式，紧接着向陌生人销售。 4. 通过做自己来进行市场营销 谈到脆弱性，极简主义企业家分享他们的故事，从挣扎到成功。最好的营销是向世界展示你和你的产品真正的样子。极简主义企业家明白人们关心的是其他人，他们会在任何时间和地点尽可能去教育、启发和娱乐。他们不是在制造头条新闻，而是在培养粉丝——这些粉丝会随着时间变成他们的客户。 5. 注重自我成长和企业发展 极简主义企业家拥有自己的企业，而不是让企业掌控他们。他们不会花钱超出自己的负担能力，也不会为了扩张而牺牲盈利能力。在这一点上，输赢已成为一种游戏……而极简主义企业家不会输。 6. 打造适合自己居住的房子 极简主义企业家雇佣其他极简主义企业家。他们不随波逐流，而是从第一原则出发构建自己的公司，虽然可能会让几乎所有人感到陌生。你的做事方式不一定适合所有人，但对一些人来说，它会非常出色。如果你早早地、频繁地定义自己的价值观，并告诉世界你是谁，那么他们会找到你。有关我们工作的常规智慧，包括何时工作和在哪里工作的观念正在迅速改变。极简主义企业家明白，规则不多。 |
| Even when you’ve successfully built your minimalist business, the journey isn’t over. Spoiler alert: It never is. Minimalist entrepreneurs know that life is about more than just their companies. The true magic of entrepreneurship is that you and your business can improve the quality of life of many people. And it doesn’t have to be millions; “enough” is what you decide it is, not a specific amount. If you’re nodding along, great. If you’re still skeptical, well, that’s okay too.

| Chase Profitability, Not Unicorns Building a minimalist business is not a get-rich-quick proposition, but it is a get-rich-slowly one if you embrace profit-ability, not growth, as the key indicator of your company’s success. Profitability means sustainability. Instead of treading water until a lifeboat comes along to save you—which is how many founders think about raising their next round of VC funding—it means building your own boat. And while I do think the minimalist entrepreneur mindset leads to a near-100-percent success rate, I’m willing to concede that it may only happen over the course of many experiments. That’s why profitability matters. If you’re profitable, you can take unlimited shots on goal, virtually guaranteeing your success as long as you keep learning from your customers. Most people don’t start. Most people who start don’t continue. Most people who continue give up. Many winners are just the last ones standing. Don’t give up. We’re moving past an era of gatekeeping, where bosses and universities and venture capitalists decide who gets to try and who doesn’t. Information about how to start and scale companies is now available to founders around the world, and it’s cheaper too, which means there are fewer and fewer reasons to raise money from venture capitalists. There’s nothing inherently wrong with raising money, and not all unicorns are evil. I raised money for Gumroad (and, as you’ll read later, have again, but in a very different way), and there are companies like Pinterest, Lyft, Slack, and others that raised venture capital, grew quickly, yet stayed focused on their customers. But much of the venture capital model depends on creating unsustainable growth and destroying successful-by-any-other-metric businesses. Why does this happen? The venture capital business is a high-risk, high-return investment strategy in which venture funds swap capital for early-stage startup equity, essentially buying a piece of the future value of the companies in which they invest. For the model to work, the rare winners like Uber, Airbnb, and Stripe need to pay for all the losers. Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures coined the term “unicorn” to refer to privately held startups valued at more than $1 billion, which are the lifeblood of venture funds. In fairy tales, people can’t help chasing unicorns—they are nearly irresistible, but they’re also rare, elusive, and nearly impossible to catch. Her mythological metaphor couldn’t have been more apt. Almost everyone fails to build billion-dollar businesses, even the founders who raise gobs of venture capital. According to Matt Murphy, managing director and partner of Menlo Ventures, approximately 70 percent of startups fail, which can mean anything from full liquidation to becoming cash flow positive, which, despite being good for the company, is still bad for the VC. Of the 30 percent still standing, he says, some return three to five times the initial investment, which constitutes only modest success in this setting. The whole system is riding on at least 5 percent of VC-backed companies delivering tenfold to one hundredfold returns to balance out losses and make it all worth it. Without them, the VC model simply doesn’t work. That’s because the outsized success of the rare billion-dollar startup compensates for all the money thrown against the wall, like so much spaghetti, on thousands of other ventures. That’s not what minimalist entrepreneurs do. We are laser focused on profitability from day one, in order to get to sustainability soon after, so that we can serve our customers and our communities for as long as we wish. | **追求盈利性而非独角兽** 构建极简主义企业并不是一个快速致富的计划，但如果你将盈利能力而非增长作为公司成功的关键指标，它将是一个慢慢致富的方法。盈利性意味着可持续性。与许多创始人抱着“先苟活着，再等着救命的救生船来”的想法一样，筹集下一轮风险投资是他们的考虑方式，而极简主义企业家则选择自己建造救生船。 虽然我确实认为极简主义企业家的思维方式会导致近乎100%的成功率，但我愿意承认这可能需要经过多次尝试。这就是为什么盈利性很重要。如果你盈利了，你就可以不断尝试，只要不断向客户学习，就几乎可以保证你的成功。大多数人不敢开始。开始了的大多数人不会坚持下去。坚持下去的大多数人最终放弃。许多胜利者只是最后一位站稳脚跟的人。不要放弃。 我们正在逐步摆脱一个由老板、大学和风险投资家决定谁有资格尝试和谁没有的时代。如今，关于如何创办和扩展企业的信息已经传播到全球各地的创始人手中，而且更便宜，这意味着越来越少的理由去向风险投资家筹集资金。筹集资金本身并没有本质上的错误，也并非所有独角兽都是邪恶的。我为Gumroad筹集过资金（而且，后来你将会读到，我又做了，但方式大不相同），还有一些公司如Pinterest、Lyft、Slack等，他们筹集了风险投资，快速成长，但仍然专注于客户。但是，风险投资模式的许多方面依赖于创造不可持续的增长，并摧毁了以其他标准衡量成功的企业。 为什么会发生这种情况呢？风险投资是一种高风险高回报的投资策略，风险基金将资本交换为早期创业企业的股权，从根本上说，就是购买他们投资的公司未来价值的一部分。为了使这个模式有效，像Uber、Airbnb和Stripe等这样的少数赢家需要为所有失败者买单。Cowboy Ventures的Aileen Lee创造了“独角兽”一词，指的是估值超过10亿美元的未上市初创公司，它们是风险基金的生命线。在童话故事中，人们无法阻止自己追逐独角兽——它们几乎是不可抗拒的，但它们也是罕见、难以捉摸且几乎无法捕捉的。 她的神话隐喻再适合不过了。几乎所有人都无法打造亿美元级的企业，即使是筹集了大量风险投资的创始人也是如此。根据Menlo Ventures的董事总经理和合伙人马特·墨菲的说法，大约70%的初创企业失败，这可能意味着从完全清算到实现现金流为正，这对公司来说虽然是好事，但对风险投资家来说却不是好消息。他说，在剩下的30%中，有些企业只能回报三到五倍的初始投资，这在这个行业只能算是适度的成功。整个系统的运作依赖于至少5 %的风险投资支持的公司带来10倍甚至100倍的回报，以平衡亏损并使其一切都变得有意义。如果没有它们，风险投资模式根本行不通。这是因为罕见的亿美元初创公司的巨大成功弥补了所有其他企业像扔在墙上的意大利面一样投入的钱。 而这不是极简主义企业家的做法。我们从一开始就专注于盈利性，以便尽快实现可持续性，这样我们可以服务于我们的客户和社区，直到我们希望结束为止。 |
| **Don’t Call It a Comeback** No matter where you work, how you work, or who you work for right now, you can use the principles in this book to rethink the beliefs and practices that may be holding you back. I really do believe that starting a business should be an option for everyone, no matter your background. That’s why this book is full of examples of many great businesses that have been built by passionate individuals around the world, many who have flown under the radar until now. For up-and-coming minimalist entrepreneurs, I hope their stories can serve as examples as new online tools make the process of building, marketing, and selling easier and cheaper for everyone— including solopreneurs and independent creators. Where do you start? Take a good hard look at the people, places, and communities you care about. Where are the pain points? What isn’t working, but might with a little elbow grease? These are all opportunities to make things better through minimalist entrepreneurship. It’s ironic to me how often people go around hoping to find a startup idea while simultaneously complaining about all the everyday stuff around them that doesn’t work properly. “Sure, I could solve that for people with a little effort, but the potential market just isn’t big enough to really scale.” That’s the kind of thinking that this book seeks to address. You may already be on your business-building journey, but if you’re just getting started, some business models lend themselves more easily to the pathway of minimalist entrepreneurship. These include almost any kind of business-to-consumer or business-to-business enterprise that has fast customer feedback loops and ample opportunities for iteration like software as a service (SaaS), digital and physical products and services, or connecting people for a fee. We’ll talk about all of these later in the book. There are also businesses that aren’t necessarily suited for this framework because of the slow pace of customer feedback. For example, any business that requires a heavy investment in research and development or that relies on sales to large, bureaucratized corporations or institutions—like Fortune 100 companies, academia, or hospitals—might not match up as well with the processes and systems I recommend. The good news is that what constitutes a “business” is changing faster than ever before and opening up possibilities to a wider range of innovators. Though this shift was in motion before 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated it and drove increased interest in entrepreneurship from people of all backgrounds. Now more than ever before, we don’t need to move to a place called Silicon Valley, go to a school called Harvard or Stanford, and raise money from the venture capitalists. The internet lets you learn from anywhere, network with anyone, and raise money directly from customers. The world desperately needs the solutions that only entrepreneurs can provide. Everyday problems are all around us, but they are often hidden from the view of the Silicon Valley software engineers and Ivy League overachievers who have been anointed as our entrepreneurial class. We need the help of entrepreneurs from every part of the planet and every stratum of society. It’s down to individual creators and entrepreneurs to set better goals for ourselves and our businesses. After all, problems don’t solve themselves. People do. | **别称之为“卷土重来”** 无论你现在在哪里工作，怎么工作，或者为谁工作，你都可以运用本书的原则来重新思考可能阻碍你前进的信念和实践。我真的相信，无论你的背景如何，创办一家企业应该是每个人的选择。这就是为什么本书充满了许多伟大企业的例子，这些企业都是由世界各地充满激情的个人建立的，很多人在此之前一直低调运作。对于新兴的极简主义企业家，我希望他们的故事能作为榜样，因为新的在线工具使得建立、营销和销售过程变得更加简单和便宜，适用于所有人，包括独立创业者和自由创作者。 你从哪里开始呢？仔细观察你关心的人、地点和社区。哪里存在问题？有哪些问题尚未解决，但是只需要一点点努力就能解决？这些都是通过极简主义企业创造更美好事物的机会。我觉得很讽刺的是，人们经常希望找到一个创业点子，同时又抱怨他们周围的日常事物根本不能正常运作。“当然，我可以通过一点点努力为人们解决这个问题，但潜在市场实在不够大，无法真正扩展。”这种思维方式正是本书试图解决的问题。 也许你已经在你的创业之旅上，但如果你刚刚开始，一些业务模式更容易适应极简主义企业的途径。这些业务包括几乎所有类型的企业对消费者或企业对企业的服务，其客户反馈回路快速，有充足的迭代机会，如软件即服务（SaaS）、数字和物理产品与服务，或者通过收费将人们联系在一起。我们将在本书后面详细讨论所有这些内容。 也有一些企业不适合这种框架，因为其客户反馈的速度较慢。例如，任何需要大量投资于研发或依赖销售给大型官僚机构或机构（如财富100强公司、学术机构或医院）的企业，可能与我推荐的流程和系统不太匹配。 好消息是，什么构成“企业”正在比以往任何时候都更快地发生变化，为更广泛的创新者开启了可能性。虽然这种转变在2020年之前就已经开始，但COVID-19大流行加速了这一过程，并引发了来自各行各业的人们对创业的兴趣。现在比以往任何时候都更不需要搬到一个名叫硅谷的地方，去一个名叫哈佛或斯坦福的学校，并从风险投资家那里筹集资金。互联网让你可以从任何地方学习，与任何人建立联系，并直接从客户那里筹集资金。 世界迫切需要只有企业家才能提供的解决方案。日常问题无处不在，但往往被硅谷软件工程师和常青藤高材生们所忽视，他们被封为我们的企业家阶层。我们需要来自地球各个角落和社会各个阶层的企业家的帮助。就是个体的创作者和企业家来为自己和我们的企业设立更高的目标。毕竟，问题不会自己解决，只有人才能解决。 |
| **Creator First, Entrepreneur Second** On paper, it seems simple enough: 1. Narrow down who your ideal customer is. Narrow until you can narrow no more. 2. Define exactly what pain point you are solving for them, and how much they will pay you to solve it. 3. Set a hard deadline and focus fully on building a solution, then charge for it. 4. Repeat the process until you’ve found a product that works, then scale a business around it. | **首先是创作者，其次才是企业家** 在纸上看起来很简单： 确定你的理想客户是谁。将范围缩小，直到无法再缩小为止。 确定你要解决的具体痛点，以及他们愿意为解决这个问题支付多少费用。 设定一个明确的截止日期，全力以赴地构建解决方案，然后开始收费。 反复进行这个过程，直到找到一个有效的产品，然后围绕它构建一个企业。 |
| In practice, it’s not so simple. There are many complications that pop up, and most people don’t even know where to start. A “business” of any kind is too scary, too amorphous, or too unattainable. Luckily, there’s another way to get started today. Before you become an entrepreneur, become a creator. | 实际上，并不是那么简单。会遇到许多意想不到的问题，而且大多数人甚至不知道从何开始。任何类型的“企业”对于他们来说太可怕、太模糊或者太难以实现了。幸运的是，现在有另一种方式可以开始。在成为企业家之前，先成为一名创作者。 |
| That could mean being an artist, but it doesn’t have to. Creators make things, charge their audiences for those things, and then use that money to make more things. They use the first dollars they earn as tools to fuel their own creative drive, not the other way around. With time and experience, creators show others how to turn their own creativity into businesses, and the cycle continues. In the end, there isn’t much difference between a business like Gumroad and a creator. It’s just semantics—one or more people using the tool of a business to make something new. Painters need brushes. Writers need pencils. Creators need businesses. It’s key for people to understand that, because it lowers the cognitive barrier to starting a business, and starting is *really* important. You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn. | 这可能意味着成为一名艺术家，但也不一定是这样。创作者创造东西，向他们的观众收费，然后用这些钱来制作更多的作品。他们将第一笔挣到的钱作为激发自己创造力的工具，而不是相反。随着时间和经验的积累，创作者向其他人展示如何将自己的创造力转化为事业，这个循环不断延续。最终，像Gumroad这样的企业和一个创作者之间并没有太大的区别。这只是一个名词上的区分——一个或多个人使用企业这个工具来创造新事物。画家需要画笔。作家需要铅笔。创作者需要企业。人们要理解这一点很重要，因为它降低了创业的认知障碍，而开始创业真的很重要。你不是先学习，再开始。你是先开始，然后再学习。 |
| My best friend in middle school, obsessed with the computer game World of Warcraft, started designing fantasy creatures in Photoshop. I was impressed, but I also remember thinking, “I could do that.” So I went through some Photoshop tutorials and got to work. When I started to get the hang of the software, I began submitting logos to online competitions. I didn’t win any, but the process of creating a lot of stuff and putting it out there made me a pretty decent designer, and then led to freelance web design work. Once you’re working on other people’s projects, you can’t help but get ideas of your own, so I began building simple web applications, hiring developers to help with the coding. For example, before Twitter natively supported threads, I created an app called Tweader to see the conversations that happened between people on Twitter. Another app, Ping Me When It’s Up, would text me when a website that had gone down was back up again. (It should be clear by now that I’ve never been very good at naming things.) When the iPhone App Store opened, I learned to code for it by taking a free course on iOS development from Stanford through iTunes University, called CS193P (I still recommend it!). The App Store handled all the financial aspects of selling what I made to customers around the world, which meant I could focus on creating apps. Perfect. The first app I built was called Taxi Lah!, which let users call a cab from their phones—before Uber. I put it on the App Store for fellow Singaporeans and made a few thousand dollars. Then I made an app called Color Stream that let designers create and modify color palettes on their phones. I made about $10,000 from that. Each time, I was trying to solve a problem I had. I wanted to design and build a little bit of software to make my life—and the lives of others—a little bit better. This experience—shipping real products to real customers— led to my first job at Pinterest, where I designed and built the Pinterest iPhone app. While I was there, I built Gumroad in my spare time to help me sell an icon I designed in Photoshop. When I found a solution that worked, I sold it to other creators, who sold their products to their own community of creators, many of whom eventually became Gumroad customers themselves. Now I’m an honest-to-goodness entrepreneur without ever having really given it much conscious thought along the way. The App Store cleared the marketing and financial obstacles out of my way so that I could fully embrace my creative side and become a creator. That transition led to me becoming a founder. It’s an upward, virtuous cycle. Creation begets more creation. Today, Gumroad does the exact same thing for other would-be creators. It’s basically a glorified Sahilcloning factory. Isn’t that beautiful? (My mom thinks it is.) Max Ulichney is an art director and illustrator based in Los Angeles. He’d always imagined he’d spend his days working at a large company to pay the bills in return for a few hours in the evening to do his own work. He spent fifteen years as an art director at the same creative agency, eventually using an iPad app called Procreate to draw and paint in between meetings. One day, a couple of years ago, Max decided to sell some of the digital “brushes” he’d designed for his own use to other Procreate users. A few hundred dollars later, he decided it was worth the effort to continue selling the digital tools as a business. Two years in, Max was making a living as an independent creator. Recently, he quit his job at the agency to work on Maxpacks full-time. | 在中学时，我最好的朋友沉迷于电脑游戏《魔兽世界》，开始在Photoshop中设计幻想生物。我被他的作品深深吸引，但同时也想着：“我也能做到这样。”于是我开始学习Photoshop的教程，并着手动手创作。当我逐渐掌握了这个软件的技巧后，我开始参加在线比赛，提交自己设计的标志。虽然没有赢得比赛，但频繁地创作并分享让我成为一个相当不错的设计师，然后我开始做自由职业的网页设计工作。 一旦你开始参与别人的项目，你不禁会萌生自己的想法，于是我开始构建简单的网络应用，并聘请开发人员来帮助编码。例如，在Twitter原生支持“线程”之前，我创建了一个名为Tweader的应用，用于查看Twitter上人们之间的对话。另一个名为“Ping Me When It's Up”的应用在一个网站崩溃后，会通过短信通知我网站恢复正常运行的情况。（现在应该很明显我从来没有擅长给东西取名字。） 当iPhone App Store开张时，我通过在iTunes University上参加斯坦福大学提供的免费iOS开发课程（CS193P）学会了开发iOS应用。App Store负责处理将我的产品销售给全球客户的所有财务方面，这意味着我可以专注于创作应用。太完美了！ 我建立的第一个应用叫做“Taxi Lah!”，让用户可以通过手机叫出出租车——在Uber出现之前。我把它放在App Store上供新加坡的用户使用，并赚了几千美元。然后我做了一个叫做“Color Stream”的应用，让设计师可以在手机上创建和修改色彩调色板。我从中赚了约一万美元。每次，我都试图解决我遇到的问题。我希望设计和构建一些小软件，让我的生活和其他人的生活变得更好一点。 这种通过向真实客户提供真实产品的经历，让我在Pinterest找到了第一份工作，我在那里设计并开发了Pinterest的iPhone应用。同时，我在闲暇时间里创建了Gumroad，帮助我将在Photoshop中设计的图标进行销售。当我找到有效的解决方案后，我把它卖给其他创作者，他们又将自己的产品卖给自己社群中的创作者，其中很多人最终成为了Gumroad的客户。如今，我成为了一个真正的企业家，但在这个过程中，我从未过多地去有意识地考虑过这一点。 App Store为我清除了市场和财务上的障碍，让我完全拥抱我的创造力，成为了一个创作者。这个转变让我成为了一个创始人。这是一个向上的良性循环。创作引发更多的创作。如今，Gumroad为其他有志创作者做着同样的事情。它基本上就是一个赞美“Sahil”的复制工厂。这不是美妙吗？（我妈妈认为是。） 马克斯·乌利克尼（Max Ulichney）是洛杉矶的一名艺术总监和插画家。他一直幻想着自己会在大公司工作，以支付账单，并在晚上抽出几个小时来做自己的工作。他在同一家创意代理公司担任了十五年的艺术总监，最后开始在iPad上使用Procreate应用在会议之间进行绘画和绘制。几年前的一天，马克斯决定将他为自己使用设计的一些数字“画笔”出售给其他Procreate用户。几百美元的收入让他决定继续将这些数字工具作为业务进行销售。两年后，马克斯成为了一个独立的创作者，靠此谋生。最近，他辞去了在代理公司的工作，全职致力于Maxpacks业务。 |
| There are thousands of “creator first, entrepreneur second” stories like Max’s. Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger teach people how to build and design web applications. They believe, as I do, that nearly anyone can become a competent front-end engineer and designer with a little help. In December 2018, after just a few years building their online audiences, they released Refactoring UI, an online course, earning over $800,000 in a single month. Now they get to spend their time doing what they really love: building Tailwind, a free and open-source framework for the rapid creation of custom web designs. | 像马克斯这样的“先创作者，后企业家”的故事有成千上万个。 亚当·瓦森（Adam Wathan）和史蒂夫·肖格尔（Steve Schoger）教人们如何构建和设计网络应用。他们和我一样相信，只要得到一点帮助，几乎任何人都可以成为一名出色的前端工程师和设计师。在仅仅几年建立了他们的在线受众后，他们于2018年12月发布了名为“重构UI”（Refactoring UI）的在线课程，仅一个月就赚了超过80万美元。如今，他们可以全身心地投入到自己真正喜欢的事情上：构建Tailwind，一个免费开源的快速创建定制网络设计的框架。 |
| Kristina Garner, mother of two boys, teaches families how to run secular, nature-based homeschooling programs for their kids. What started as a blog in 2015 about her personal passion has become Blossom and Root, a business that employs dozens of people and helps thousands of families every month. These are just a few of the 28,207 creators who sold something on Gumroad last month. That sounds like a big number today, but I too started somewhere smaller and less lofty, where creation always begins: at the number next to zero. Where there was nothing, now there’s something: digital brushes, online courses, Vidalia onions on your doorstep. In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to get started. KEY TAKEAWAYS ο You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn. ο Minimalist entrepreneurs focus on getting “profitable at costs” instead of growing at all costs. ο A business is a way to solve problems for people you care about—and get paid for it. ο Become a creator first, an entrepreneur second. | 克里斯蒂娜·加纳（Kristina Garner）是两个男孩的母亲，她教导家庭如何为孩子们打造非宗教的、以自然为基础的家庭学校教育计划。起初，她在2015年创建的博客只是关于她个人热情的记录，但现在已经成为Blossom and Root，一家雇佣了数十名员工，每月帮助数千个家庭的企业。 这只是在上个月在Gumroad上售出产品的28,207位创作者中的一部分。听起来今天这个数字很大，但我也是从一个更小更谦逊的地方开始的，创作始终从“零”这个数字开始。从无到有，数字笔刷、在线课程、装满你门口的维迪利亚洋葱。 在下一章中，我将向你展示如何入门。 关键要点： ο 你不是先学习，再开始。你是先开始，然后再学习。 ο 精简主义企业家专注于“以成本盈利”，而不是不惜一切代价扩张。 ο 企业是为你关心的人解决问题的方式，并为此获得报酬。 ο 首先成为一名创作者，其次才是企业家。 |
